# Database
A television station has a large collection of audiovisual content on its system. Knowing this, the idea of ​​creating a streaming platform to catalog your content online comes up. To do this, you need to create and model a database to store the entire basis of your business. In this way, a mini-world was generated with the following specifications: For each user, personal information must be stored: The service provides vast content to the user, including films, documentaries and series. All content must have at least one display language. All content must have at least one actor and one director. An actor can be a director in the same audiovisual content, and vice versa. You will need to store different attributes for each category of audiovisual content. For films and documentaries, their genre and the names of the screenwriters. For series, the number of existing seasons. For each series, it is mandatory that there is at least one season, stating its name, season number, number of episodes and a list containing the names of all its episodes. As previously mentioned, an artist can, at the same time, be classified as an actor or director.
